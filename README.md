# Financial-Data-Dashboard
Hello GitHub mates, I have used some dummy financial data and created a user interactive data dashboard on Microsoft Power BI. You can use this as an example or reuse it as an template to create your own marvellous master piece.

The Power BI dashboard is totally interactive, whatever data point you choose, the other data chart changes accordingly.

This is one of the best way to know all the information one needs to about the past and present financial data.

I have attached the sample data file too just in case if you want to come up with a better looking dashboard haha.

I hope you enjoy the interaction with my dashboard. 

Updates and changes are welcomed. You can contact me too if you have any questions about Power BI.
Cheers.
